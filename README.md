# 🛠️ MeatLogic – From Incomplete Exam Project to Skill Showcase

I couldn’t complete this project during my **End Semester exam** due to time limitations.  
But I didn’t leave it behind.

After the exams, I returned to it and used the opportunity to:
- ✅ Practice and improve my frontend development skills
- 🎨 Add better styles, color gradients, and UI polish
- 🌀 Implement animations and transitions
- 💻 Make it responsive across devices

This repo reflects my learning journey — from incomplete assignment to a cleaner, better project that shows what I can now build.
